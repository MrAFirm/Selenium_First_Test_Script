# Selenium_First_Test_Script
An Automation Project where I followed the tutorial from TutorialPoints.com to create my first test script using the IntelliJ IDE with Apache Maven, Java and TestNG plugin.

When you run "ActualTest.java" in the src/test/Java/DriverEngine package, it'll go into the TutorialsPoint Selenium Tutorial Website, find the radio button, click yes, and quit, referring excel sheet for keywords.

Otherwise known as Keyword Driven Framework Testing.
